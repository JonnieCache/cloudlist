    %h1 SoundCloud m3u Convertor
    %p this takes soundcloud users and gives you back a playlist of their tracks in m3u form, which you can then drop into your player of choice, be it itunes, VLC, winamp, or if you are in fact a gentleman, foobar2000.
    %p therefore you can listen to them however you please and you don't have to have a firefox tab full of ugly flash objects open all the time. I imagine this would also probably be pretty helpful to users of those snazzy smartphone things but I wouldn't know as I can't afford one.
    %p 
      simply pop the users's profile address in the box and hit generate, eg
      %a{:href => 'http://soundcloud.com/jonnie-cache'} http://soundcloud.com/jonnie-cache
    
    %form{:action => '/generate', :id => 'm3u'}
      %input{:type => :text, :name => :url, :id => :url}
      %input{:type => :submit, :value => 'Generate'}
